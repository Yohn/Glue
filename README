This plugin is for people who want to add Wordpress to a Vanilla Forum community. 

WARNING
=======
If you already have an existing Wordpress site and just installed a new Vanilla forum, this *IS NOT* the plugin for you. See the "VanillaForums" plugin for Wordpress instead.

VanillaPress will forcefully sync your Wordpress Users table to your Vanilla User table. This means existing Wordpress-only users WILL BE DELETED FOREVER.

This means even your Wordpress admin users will be deleted. You will log in with your Vanilla admin account after install.

BACKUP YOUR DATABASE, CONFIG FILES, AND ANY CUSTOMIZATIONS BEFORE INSTALLING VANILLAPRESS.

REQUIREMENTS
============
1. Wordpress 3.0 and Vanilla 2.0.18
2. Wordpress and Vanilla MUST be installed in the same database.
3. Wordpress and Vanilla MUST be accessed from the same domain.
